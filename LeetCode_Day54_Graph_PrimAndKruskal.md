# LeetCode Day 52,53 Graph Union Find

Disjoint Set (Union-Find Algorithm)

*Two sets are called* ***\*disjoint sets\**** *if they donâ€™t have any element in common*

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:

- Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
- Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using ***\*Union\**** operation.
- Finding representative of a disjoint set using ***\*Find\**** operation.
- Check if two sets are disjoint or not.
